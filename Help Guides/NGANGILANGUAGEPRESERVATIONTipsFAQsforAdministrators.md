Note: Once released to production, all nganÕgi urls in this document should be updated from https://ngangi-staging.intersect.org.au to the Production url.

For general logged-in Contributors:
1. General Principles on the website for Communities, Collections and Protocols: 
### Communities 
* Communities can be large or small, public or private, and your Mukurtu site can have as many communities as needed. Communities can be large or small, public or private, and your Mukurtu site can have as many communities as needed.
* Each community represents a group of content contributors and site users and contains digital heritage items relevant to those community members. User access to individual digital heritage items within a community is managed through the use of cultural protocols that are created within the community.
* Some examples of communities could be specific families or clans, tribal government departments, or a space for youth-appropriate content.
### Cultural Protocols 
* Each cultural protocol exists within a community, and each community can have multiple cultural protocols. Digital heritage items are placed within at least one cultural protocol and can then be viewed by users who are also members of those protocols.
* There are two types of cultural protocols: open and strict. Digital heritage items within an open protocol can be viewed by anyone (including anonymous site visitors), while items within a strict protocol can only be viewed by members of that protocol. Multiple protocols can be layered to ensure that users can only view items appropriate for them, and to provide very granular access. For example, if an item is part of the two strict protocols ÔWomen OnlyÕ and ÔElders Only,Õ then only users who are members of both the ÔWomen OnlyÕ and ÔElders OnlyÕ protocols can view that item.
* Some examples of cultural protocols could be gender-based (male only, female only), age-based (elders only, no youth), seasonal access only, clan or tribal affiliation, secret/sacred, community only, or public access/open.
### Categories 
* Categories are terms that describe your digital heritage items. They should be broad enough that each item on your site is represented by at least one category and so each category describes many items. For example, ÔFishingÕ or ÔFoodÕ may make good categories as they could apply to a range of items, but ÔsalmonÕ may not make a good category, as it is likely to only apply to a small number of items. For narrower or more specialized terms, consider using keywords. More information about keywords is available in the support article Using Categories and Keywords.
* Most Mukurtu sites usually have around 10-15 categories, but the categories chosen should reflect the collection and users.
* Some examples of commonly used categories include Lifeways, Education, Lands, Architecture and Dwellings, Language, Ceremony, and Artistry and Artifacts.

TIP: http://mukurtu.org/mobile/ ? with Apple & Android downloads may make data editing easier on devices. ?There's a Help Guide at https://github.com/MukurtuCMS/mukurtu-mobile/wiki/02_User's-Guide?, but weÕve noticed in a quick look through that the only way to publish Videos from the app (at the time of writing this help guide)  is via a YouTube login, so ?possibly it won't suit all UserÕs purposes, but we think worth a look to see if it makes mobile usage any easier for you.

That email will stay available at mailinator for a few hours. If the user needs to recover a password, the same method of go to https://www.mailinator.com/  and enter in the address theyÕve used will also allow the user to recover an account.

* FAQ: As a Community Administrator, ItÕs not obvious to me how I control what a community sees. Can I specify that an item is visible to all communities by specifying all, or by not specifying any? Answer: 
1. Specific to Ngan'gi site: https://ngangi-staging.intersect.org.au./dashboard/communities shows specifically how your own Communities > Protocols  are currently working, with Edit links to each Protocol
2. http://support.mukurtu.org/customer/en/portal/articles/2430079-how-do-user-roles-and-permissions-work- gives a good overview on how Permissions/Communities/Protocols work, and the linked MukurtuUserRoles_PermissionMatrix.pdf shows a further overview of how the Permissions work on the site.
* FAQ: IÕve created a new community and want to invite someone to join. ThereÕs both ÔAdd MembersÕ and  ÔInvite UsersÕ tabs, but both state the email address I enter to be Ôthe following user does not existÕ. Need my invited guest already be a user before being an invitee? Can I invite a User unknown to the website? Answer: No, the invitee needn't be logged into the system first if you are an Administrator. To invite a new user:  
1. Logged in, from homepage, use "+ User" link in main navigation should take you to https://ngangi-staging.intersect.org.au/admin/people/create. Here you can add a not-previously-logged User, assign them roles, and add them directly to a Community (or more than one). They'll receive an email which has a link to access the site where they can create their own password. 
2. Alternatively, from Dashboard (https://.../dashboard),  go to (Site Users) -> Add User -> https://ngangi-staging.intersect.org.au/admin/people/create. 
3. Once a user is in the system, you can additionally add them to a Community/Protocol via that Community/Protocol  > Edit > Invite
* FAQ: IÕve figured out the Scald Library, and have successfully added an image to it and then accessed that image to add it to a Digital Heritage item. That item was a photo, but it doesnÕt automatically appear under the ÔPhotographsÕ tab. Answer: If you want photos to show to all site visitors e.g. via the "Photographs" link, you need permission to edit the "Photographs" page directly and add/delete photos as usual (by adding through Scald) - Note though, the ÒPhotographsÓ page is currently visible to every visitor to the site, even unlogged users . 
1. Permissions may be added to individual photographs if/as they're added as Digital Heritage Items to only display to certain Community/Protocol members. To subsequently view these content items you need to be  a member of the nominated Community/Protocol to enable access to them.
2. There's probably several ways to do this, but one way to review what you've already added to Scald is to is to go to Dashboard >  (Content and Collections) > View Media (https://ngangi-staging.intersect.org.au/admin/content/atoms)
3. This differ?s from the 'Audio-Video' link which updates with anything that's been added as a "+ Digital Heritage" item
* FAQ: How can I add an EOPAS item?
Precondition 1: The following is assuming the files being uploaded have been processed by ELAN software - See https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/ for ELAN download and User guides for ELAN) 
Precondition 2: Video & Audio files able to be uploaded  to EOPAS:  wav, mp3, mov, mp4 (these will be transcoded to the (ogg) streaming format - future plans include transcoding to WebM and MP4, but these are not available in the current version of EOPAS). Please be patient as it can take a few minutes to complete the uploading and transcoding process.
1. As a user with permission to upload to EOPAS, go to <insert Production url> (https://eopas-staging.intersect.org.au/ for Demo). User may have to register and youÕll receive an email which will give them access to the site)
2. Once logged into the EOPAS server:
3. Click on ÒUpload mediaÓ (on the top bar)

6. Then, back on the homepage, click on ÒUpload TranscriptsÓ (on the top bar)
7. Go through the same process as with the video. Fill in metadata and upload .eaf file. (.eaf file is the ELAN export, which EOPAS accepts along with some other xml formats)
8. Save this transcript record. 
9. Go to "Browse TranscriptsÓ and click on the record you added. 
10. In the top-left corner, click on Òlink to video recordÓ (NEED TO CHECK THIS) and find the relevant video/audio and select the ÒAttachÓ link
