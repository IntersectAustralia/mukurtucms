## FAQs 
I added a photograph and it’s not showing on the “Photographs” tab. Answer: The “Photographs” tab content needs page to be edited directly to make photographs display - i.e. As a mukurtu user, go to https://ngangi-staging.intersect.org.au/photographs-menu#overlay-context= and select edit, and images can be added to the page from the scald interface.
